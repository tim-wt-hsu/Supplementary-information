# Supplementary-information
we employ TetraMAX to examine the redundant circuitry by checking that the inserted trigger isn't undetectable redundant.

| Benchmark  | Trigger Fault Class |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| wb_conmax  |  DS (Detected by Simulation) | 
|aes_128	    |  DS|
|s13207	    |  DS|
|s15850	    |  DS|
|s38417	    |  DS|
|b15	        |  DS|

*If the the inserted signal is redundant, the fault class will be UR (Undetected Redundant)
